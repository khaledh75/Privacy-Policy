Bondo App - Privacy Policy

1. Introduction
Welcome to Bondo App ("the App"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our App.

2. Information We Collect
We may collect the following types of information:
- Personal Information: When you create an account, we may collect personal information such as your name, email address, and phone number.
- Phone Number Verification: For safety and accountability, certain actions in the App (such as sending private messages, replying to messages or voice notes, or posting new voice/text notes) require you to provide and verify your phone number.
- Voice Notes: When you record and post voice notes, we collect and store these recordings.
- Location Data: We collect your location data to allow you to pin voice notes to specific locations on the map. Location data may also be used for optional in-app surveys or features (such as visualizing aggregated preferences on a map). Participation in such surveys (e.g., football team choice) is completely optional, and you may choose not to provide a response. Individual responses are never displayed publicly, only aggregated results (e.g., map colors).
- Chat Data: When using the chat feature, we collect and store the message content, sender ID, timestamps, and full name associated with each message.
- Usage Data: We collect information about how you interact with the App, such as the features you use and the frequency of your usage.


3. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
- Provide and improve our services.
- Facilitate real-time communication via chat.
- Personalize your experience on the App.
- Communicate with you about updates, promotions, and other information related to the App.
- Ensure the security and functionality of the App.
- Verify user identity and prevent misuse of the App by requiring phone number verification before enabling private communication features.
- Provide interactive features such as optional surveys (e.g., football team  preferences) and display anonymized, aggregated results on the map without exposing individual user choices.

4. Sharing Your Information
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information with:
- Service Providers: We may share information with third-party service providers who help us operate and maintain the App (e.g., Firebase for backend infrastructure and chat storage).
- Legal Requirements: We may disclose information if required by law or if we believe it is necessary to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of others.

Note: Your chat messages are stored in Firebase and are accessible only to authorized admin personnel for moderation, safety, or legal purposes. We do not share chat data with any third-party advertising or analytics tools.

5. Data Security
We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure.

Please Note:
Currently, messages sent through our chat feature are not end-to-end encrypted. We recommend avoiding the sharing of sensitive personal information through chat.

6. Your Choices
You have the following choices regarding your personal information:
- Access and Update: You can access and update your personal information through your account settings.
- Delete Account: You can delete your account and all associated data by contacting us at Bondoapp@gmail.com.

Our App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the App. Your continued use of the App after the changes have been made will signify your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.

10. Crash Reporting and Diagnostics
We use a third-party service called Sentry to help us identify and fix technical issues in the App. Sentry automatically collects diagnostic data such as device information, operating system version, app version, and crash logs. This data is used solely to improve app performance and reliability and is not used for tracking or advertising purposes. For more information about how Sentry handles data, please refer to [Sentry's Privacy Policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

11. Our App uses the Branch SDK to enable deep linking and, where enabled, marketing attribution. Depending on the configuration, Branch may process device identifiers, 
engagement events, and campaign parameters (such as source, medium, and campaign name) to provide analytics and attribution. This information is used to help us understand 
how users discover and interact with the App and to improve our services.  
For more details about how Branch handles data, please review [Branchâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://branch.io/policies/#privacy).
